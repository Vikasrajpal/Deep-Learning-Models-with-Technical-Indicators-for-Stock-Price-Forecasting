# Deep-Learning-Models-with-Technical-Indicators-for-Stock-Price-Forecasting
This project proposes a BiLSTM  approach to predict the stock closing price of the next day. The method uses opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, volume, turnover, ups &amp; downs along with Stock Technical Indicators as the input, making full use of the time sequence characteristics of the stock data.
