# Deep-Learning-Models-with-Technical-Indicators-for-Stock-Price-Forecasting
Description: This is for learning, studying, researching, and analyzing stock in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML). Predicting Stock with Machine Learning method or Deep Learning method with different types of algorithm. Experimenting in stock data to see how it works and why it works or why it does not work that way. Using different types of stock strategies in machine learning or deep learning. Using Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis in machine learning or deep learning to predict the future stock price. In addition, to predict stock in long terms or short terms.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence involved with the creating of algorithms that can change itself without human intervention to produce an output by feeding itself through structured data. On the other hand, deep learning is a subset of machine learning where algorithms created, but the function are like machine learning and many of the different type of algorithms give a different interpretation of the data. The network of algorithms called artificial neural networks and is similar to neural connections that exist in the human brain.


# Recurrent Neural Network
RNN works on the principle of saving the output of a particular layer and feeding this back to the input in order to predict the output of the layer.
An RNN can handle sequential data, accepting the current input data, and previously received inputs. RNNs can memorize previous inputs due to their internal memory.
